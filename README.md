# Extract-source-code-function-banner-data-to-excel
Function banner in source code is mandatory and many a times the same data must be transferred to an excel sheet. The task seems pretty simple until you realize there are 1000's of functions in real world application. Copy pasting each line seems exhausting and time consuming. So, I came up with an idea to transfer the data in the source code function banner to an excel reducing almost 80% of my workload. There could be different variants in showcasing the function banner so I have provided few python scripts that can be chosen according to your needs. In addition to that, there are few places that needs to be mentioned in the source code (src code path, headings, etc...) and you can be able to find them in comments.
